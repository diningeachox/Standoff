# Standoff

## Introduction

Standoff is a deckbuilding game with an area control element which gives rise to a lot of tactics and calculation. Players represent giant galactic empires locked in a bitter stalemate in a protracted war. In order to gain a decisive edge over their opponents, the armies take the battle to the planet Zirconia, which hosts an ancient powerful superweapon (known as “The Red Gun”). Whoever takes control of The Red Gun will be able to turn the tide in the galactic war and overcome all of their opponents.
