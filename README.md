# Standoff

## Introduction

Standoff is a deckbuilding game inspired by Dominion with a board element which gives rise to a lot of tactics and calculation. Players represent giant galactic empires locked in a bitter stalemate in a protracted war. In order to gain a decisive edge over their opponents, the armies take the battle to the planet Zirconia, which hosts an ancient powerful superweapon (known as “The Red Gun”). Whoever takes control of The Red Gun will be able to turn the tide in the galactic war and overcome all of their opponents. 

## Setup
Place 16 black 1 x 1 blocks into the game board as follows: (basically 4 groups of 4 with a distance of 3 from the edges):

Sort the following 8 cards into their own piles. These cards will form the **permanent market**.

Put all other cards into a different pile, shuffle the pile, and flip the top 8 cards of the pile face-up to form the **temporary market**.

Each player takes 6 copies of <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24876548/24582721/b4c6e58c-1703-11e7-8bfb-9f2530ff94b9.png" width="132" height="160"> and 4 copies of <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24876548/24582716/b0a97582-1703-11e7-82af-f3755cdbab68.png" width="132" height="160"> to form his/her starting deck.

## Resources
There are two resources in Standoff, **credits** and **minerals**. 

## Phases of a turn
Each turn is composed of three phases.

### Upkeep phase:
This is the phase during which players have to pay “upkeep”, i.e. resolve leftover effects from previous turns. Certain cards will indicate certain effects to happen during the upkeep phases, and all such effects are resolved automatically during the upkeep phase. 

### Action phase:
This is the phase during which a player may play up 4 actions. An action consists of one of the following:

•	Drawing a card: If the player's deck is not empty, then he/she adds the top card of his/her deck to her hand. If the player's deck is empty, then that player shuffles the discard pile and the discard pile will form his/her deck. Then the player draws a card from the new deck. If both the player's deck and discard pile are empty, then nothing happens.

•	Discarding a card from the hand: The player places one card of his/her choosing into his/her discard pile.

•	Playing an action card: The player pays resources equal to the cost indicated by the bottom-left corner, then resolves the effects of the action card. After the effect is resolved, the action card is placed into the discard pile (unless the card indicates otherwise). 

•	Playing a polyomino card: The player pays resources equal to the cost indicated by the bottom-left corner, then takes the number of 1 x 1 blocks of his/her colour equal to the amount indicated on the polyomino card. The player then places those blocks onto the field in one contiguous group. Legal placements are ones such that at least one block in the contiguous group is adjacent to the edge of the field or a block of the same colour. 

•	Buying a card from the market:  The player pays resources equal to the cost indicated by the bottom-right corner, then places the card into his/her discard pile. 





Most actions require resources to play. To add resources, a player plays resource cards as free actions to gain credits. Moreover, action cards, satellite cards, and polyomino cards CANNOT be played at all if you have negative credits in your budget, even if the card in question costs 0 credits to play. 
If there are no more cards left in a player’s deck and he/she chooses to draw, then first shuffle the discard pile into the deck before drawing. 

### Discard phase:
Standoff has a maximum hand size of 7. After all available actions have been taken by a player and he/she has more than 7 cards in hand, he/she must discard down to 7 cards. Note that under normal circumstances, the discard phase is the only phase in which players may discard! (Unless a card indicates otherwise)

If the player has less than 5 cards in hand, that player draws up to 5.
